        "  - Following are the key assumptions of simple linear regression:\n",
        "  - Linearity: A linear relationship exists between the dependent variable, Y, and independent variable X. When fitting a linear model, we first assume that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. If the relationship between the two variables is non-linear, it will produce erroneous results because the model will underestimate or overestimate the dependent variable at certain points. Another implication of this assumption is that that X, the independent variable, should not be random because if it is random, there will be no linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
        "  - Homoskedasticity: For all observations, the variance of the regression residuals is the same.The homoskedasticity assumption states that for all observations, the variance of the residual is the same. This assumption relates to the squared residuals.\n",
        "  - Independence: The observation X and Y pairs are independent of one another. While conducting a simple linear regression, we assume that the X and Y pairs of observation are not correlated, and the residuals will not be correlated. To ensure that the variances of the estimated parameters are correctly estimated, the assumption that the residuals are not correlated across the X and Y observation pairs is crucial. It is important to examine the residuals statistically and visually for a regression model to ensure that the residuals do not exhibit a pattern that suggests a violation of the assumptions.\n",
        "  - Normality: A normal distribution exists among regression residuals.This assumption requires that the residuals from the model should be normally distributed. It is good practice for an analyst to understand the distribution of the independent and dependent variables to check for outliers that can affect the fitted line. When residuals are normally distributed, we can test a specific hypothesis about a linear regression model.\n"

The y-intercept is a constant value in the equation, which shifts the line up or down without changing its slope.

        "  - Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. This violates the assumption of independence among predictors and can significantly affect the regression analysis.\n",
        "  - Multicollinearity reduces the interpretability of regression coefficients. When predictors are highly correlated, the model struggles to distinguish their individual effects on the dependent variable. This leads to unstable and imprecise coefficient estimates, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the relationships between variables.\n",
        "  - It does not increase the accuracy of the regression model. While multicollinearity does not directly affect the model's predictive power, it inflates the standard errors of the coefficients. This makes it harder to determine which predictors are statistically significant.\n",

This is typically done through one-hot encoding, where each category of the categorical variable is represented as a binary column. This technique allows the model to treat each category as a separate predictor, which can help in avoiding the dummy variable trap and ensuring that all features are equally weighted. Other methods such as label encoding can also be used, but they are generally less effective for ordinal data and may not be suitable for all types of categorical data.\n"

        "  - The slope in regression analysis significantly affects predictions by quantifying the change in the dependent variable for every unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable as the independent variable increases by one unit. For example, in a linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage, the slope would indicate the average increase in price for each additional square foot of the house. If the slope is positive, it means that as square footage increases, the price of the house tends to increase. Conversely, a negative slope would indicate that as square footage increases, the price of the house tends to decrease. Understanding the slope is crucial for making informed predictions and decisions based on the data."

        "  - Symmetry and Lack of Directionality: R² measures the correlation between the input (x) and output (y) variables. It is symmetric, meaning that flipping the input and output variables will yield the same R² value. This symmetry is problematic because a good prediction metric should depend on the direction of the relationship between the input and output variables.\n",
        "  - Independence from Model Parameters: R² can be calculated without fitting the regression model, as it does not depend on the model's residuals, slope, or intercept.

However, a low adjusted R² value suggests that the model's predictive power is not being utilized effectively. This situation often arises when the model has been overfit to the training data, meaning it has learned the noise as well as the signal. To address this issue, it is recommended to use additional validation metrics, such as cross-validation, and consider adjusting the model by removing unnecessary predictors or using regularization techniques."

However, scaling the target variable (y) is not always necessary — it depends on the algorithm, data scale, and optimization method. When scaling the target is not required If you solve the regression analytically (Normal Equation) or your target values are within a reasonable range, scaling y will not change the model’s predictions after inverse transformation. The coefficients will simply adjust to match the target’s scale, and the shape of the fitted function remains the same.\n"

        "  - Polynomial Regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable as an n-th degree polynomial. It is particularly useful when the data shows a non-linear trend that a straight line cannot capture effectively. General equation for degree n: [ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2x^2 + ... + \\beta_nx^n + \\epsilon ] Here, the model is still linear in coefficients but can fit curved patterns in the data."

        "  - The decision to use linear regression or polynomial regression depends on the nature of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in your dataset. Below are key considerations to help you determine which approach is better suited for your problem.\n",
        "  - Linear Regression: Linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It is ideal when the data shows a linear trend, meaning changes in the independent variable result in proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
        "  - When to Use Linear Regression:\n",
        "    - The relationship between variables is linear.\n",
        "    - Simplicity and interpretability are important.\n",
        "    - The dataset is relatively small, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "  - It serves as a good baseline model for initial analysis.\n",
        "  - Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, making it suitable for non-linear relationships. It can model curves and complex patterns that linear regression cannot.\n",

        "25. When is polynomial regression used?\n",
        "  - Polynomial regression is a statistical technique used when the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is non-linear. Unlike linear regression, which fits a straight line, polynomial regression fits a curve to the data by introducing higher-degree terms of the independent variable.\n",
        "  - Key Scenarios for Using Polynomial Regression\n",
        "    - Non-Linear Relationships: It is ideal when the data exhibits a curvilinear pattern that cannot be captured by a straight line. For example, modeling chemical reactions or salary progression over years of experience often requires polynomial regression.\n",
        "    - Residual Patterns: If a linear regression model shows a clear pattern in the residuals (e.g., a \"U\" shape), it indicates that a linear model is insufficient. A polynomial regression model can better capture such patterns.\n",
        "    - Improved Model Fit: When comparing models, if the adjusted R-squared value of a polynomial regression is significantly higher than that of a linear regression, it suggests that the polynomial model provides a better fit.\n",
        "    - Flexibility for Complex Data: Polynomial regression allows for more flexibility by introducing higher-degree terms, making it suitable for modeling complex relationships.\n",
